Code Review:

this python script is for handling the model/design of each class and its variables/parameters.

from sqlmodel import SQLModel

we import SQLModel from sqlmodel

class UserCreate(SQLModel):
    # I decided to add a username but make it optional
    email : str
    username : str | None = None
    password : str

I created a class UserCreate that inherits from SQLModel and inside it, I specified pairs such as email as string, username as string or None since while in user creation phase username is optional, and password as string

class UserRead(SQLModel):
    # I need to make the UserRead None username otherwise it will raise an error
    id: int
    username: str | None = None
    email: str

this class, the UserRead class if for identifying which user is currently logged in, and it inherits from SQLModel. I specified the pairs, id as int, username as string or None, and email as string.

class UserRead(SQLModel):
    # I need to make the UserRead None username otherwise it will raise an error
    id: int
    username: str | None = None
    email: str

this class, the UserRead class if for identifying which user is currently logged in, and it inherits from SQLModel. I specified the pairs, id as int, username as string or None, and email as string.

class UserLogin(SQLModel):
    email: str
    password: str

UserLogin is another class that inherits from SQLModel, it is used as login values that user might enter, it has pair parameters: email as string, and password as string.

class Token(SQLModel):
    access_token: str
    token_type: str = "bearer"

this class called Token also inherits from SQLModel, its main purpose is to hold the token from JWT and store the token to access_token as a string and token_type as string and specified it as Bearer


models/journal_models.py

full code:

from sqlmodel import SQLModel
from datetime import date

class CreateTrade(SQLModel):
    asset_coin : str
    value_entered : float
    value_outcome : float
    date_open : date
    date_closed : date | None = None
    note : str |None = None
    strategy : str | None = None
    p_l : bool | None = None
    

code review:

from sqlmodel import SQLModel
from datetime import date

the imports, I imported SQLModel from sqlmodel and also date from datetime since there is no built-in time and date for python unless called as a package

class CreateTrade(SQLModel):
    asset_coin : str
    value_entered : float
    value_outcome : float
    date_open : date
    date_closed : date | None = None
    note : str |None = None
    strategy : str | None = None
    p_l : bool | None = None
    
for journal I only need 1 class for creating a trade so I created a class called CreateTrade that inherited from SQLModel and has value pairs, the notable parts are the ones without | None = None and the ones that have it. basically all the pairs that have None = None are all optional fields and the code will not break whether or not they have a value inserted by the user, but the ones that don't contain them are required fields
