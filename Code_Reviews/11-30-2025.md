model/auth_models.py code review

full code:
from sqlmodel import SQLModel

class UserCreate(SQLModel):
    # I decided to add a username but make it optional
    email : str
    username : str | None = None
    password : str
    
class UserRead(SQLModel):
    # I need to make the UserRead None username otherwise it will raise an error
    id: int
    username: str | None = None
    email: str

class UserLogin(SQLModel):
    email: str
    password: str

class Token(SQLModel):
    access_token: str
    token_type: str = "bearer"


Code Review:

this python script is for handling the model/design of each class and its variables/parameters.

from sqlmodel import SQLModel

we import SQLModel from sqlmodel

class UserCreate(SQLModel):
    # I decided to add a username but make it optional
    email : str
    username : str | None = None
    password : str

I created a class UserCreate that inherits from SQLModel and inside it, I specified pairs such as email as string, username as string or None since while in user creation phase username is optional, and password as string

class UserRead(SQLModel):
    # I need to make the UserRead None username otherwise it will raise an error
    id: int
    username: str | None = None
    email: str

this class, the UserRead class if for identifying which user is currently logged in, and it inherits from SQLModel. I specified the pairs, id as int, username as string or None, and email as string.

class UserRead(SQLModel):
    # I need to make the UserRead None username otherwise it will raise an error
    id: int
    username: str | None = None
    email: str

this class, the UserRead class if for identifying which user is currently logged in, and it inherits from SQLModel. I specified the pairs, id as int, username as string or None, and email as string.

class UserLogin(SQLModel):
    email: str
    password: str

UserLogin is another class that inherits from SQLModel, it is used as login values that user might enter, it has pair parameters: email as string, and password as string.
